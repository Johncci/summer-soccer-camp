{View live project here} (url to be pasted)

This website was created to advertise a soccer camp for kids in suncroft, co. Kildare. It's goal is to encourage parents to sign up there kids to our soccer camps.

## User Experience

### Visitor Goals

- The primary goal of this website is to appeal to parents and gurardians of children to sign up for our summer camp.

- The main image at the top of the page is intentionally of younger children to show that we are inclusive of the younger children and they are not too young or small to participate.

- The page is intended to be user friendly for navigation. I have designed a simple sign up page to make sign up a simple and quick process.

- The Google Maps image at the foot of the page gives easy directions to the camp location.

### Returning Visitor Goals

- I am aware that a hight perecentage of visitors will not sign up initially as they will possibly have a converstation with there partner and children about signing the child up. I designed the page to have a appearence of simplistic design to encourage users to return and not be intimidated by to much detail.

- i have encouraged bookmarking the page in the aboutus section to encourage future ease of access.
