<h1 align="center">Summer Soccer Camp</h1>




## <U>**Motivation**</U>
The Summer Soccer Camp website was created to advertise a soccer camp for kids in suncroft, co. Kildare. It's goal is to encourage parents to sign up their kids to our soccer camps. My motivation for this project is based on my own involvement with training kids from a young age. When I was growing up there was no such facilities or programs in place. I want to create something to give all children a great chance to develop there football abilities from a young age and to make new friends. I have found it is a great way to help them develop both physically and mentally.

The Summer Soccer Camp website is aimed at both parents and their children. The Initial view of the website will most likely be from a parent and the information provided is relative to the parent. The imagery of the website were created with the intention of making it easier for both the parent and child to gain an insight into what the camp involves. The overall aim is that the easy to find information and the imagery will allow both parent and child to reach what is often a mutual decision to attend this summer camp.

## <u>**Designs**</u>

* **Colour Scheme**

  * The below image was taken from the website colorhexa.com and it is an eaxample of the main colour displayed in this site. The original colour picked was a light green colour with a value of #ccf381. This colour was chosen in place of #ccf381 as it is considered a web safe colour as shown in colorhexa.com. 
The other colours displayed on the site are whitesmoke and black. The whitesmoke colour was chosen for the purpose of emphasising the foreground display. Black was used for all font colours with red used for all hover actions.

  * The website used for the colour scheme is [Color hexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/ccff99). I have attached a screenshot of the particular colour used.

  <br>

  ![Webpage used for main colour styling](assets/images/color-styling.png)

  <br>

* **Font-family**

  * Roboto was used for the headings on the site. It is a Sans-Serif font. The back up font selected was San-Serif.

  * Lato was used for the body of the site. It is also a Sans-Serif font. The back up Font selected was Sans-Serif.

* **Imagery**

  * All imagery was used with the permission of their owners. I have credited all of these in the Credits section of this README.md File.

<br>

## <U>**Accessibility**</U>

* I have been conscientious of achieving the maximum amount of accessibility possible by completing the following actions:

  * Using semantic HTML.

  * Using alt attribute with images on the site. There are two exceptions to the use of alt attributes. The first is the main image on  the home page which has a text circle inserted to assist screen readers and the background image on the sign up page which is there for background decorative purposes.

  * Ensuring sufficent colour contrast throughout the site

  * Adding text to the social media elements on the footer to assist screen readers.

<br>

## <U>**Technologies Implemented**</U>

* The following technologies were implemented in the construction and design of this website.

  * HTML and CSS - To create this website.

  * Git - For version control.

  * Github - To save and store the files for the website construction.

  * Google Fonts - To import the fonts used on the website.

  * Font awesome - To create the social media icons on the footer.

  * Google dev tools - To troubleshoot and test features and to monitor and adjudt the website to ensure it is responsive.

  * Tiny PNG - To compress images.

  * Am I Responsive? - To show the website image on a range of devices.

  * Ezgif.com - To optimize images.

  <br>

## <U>**Testing and Bugs**</U>

* Testing was an ongoing process from the start to the finish of the build. I used a chrome developer tools to assist me in solving problems as I progressed through the project. I encountered the following build issues and bugs as I progressed through the project.

  1. The main image would not conform to my intended page size. At this point in the project I was using float elements to align my page. I then learned how to use flex properties and when I used flex properties it was easier to align the main image.

  2. The image in the about us section on the home page was creating a white margin on the right of the page when screen width reached 487px. I identified this issue using chrome developer tools. I applied an overflow value of hidden to the relevant media query to prevent this form happening.

  3. The lighthouse test on developer tools is displaying a score of 75 for performance on the mobile text. I discussed this with my mentor and the possible explanation is the size of the main image and reached a conclusion which i discuss in the lighthouse section later in this readme.md file.

  4. The form name element in the input id for parent did not have sufficient indiviual detail as highlighted by my mentor. This was causing a problem when submittimg the form as there are two submission fields for parent/guardian and child.

  5. I encountered difficulty postioning in the home page with the about us section. I was using float properties at this time, I could not get the image div and the text div to display side by side. I spoke to my mentor about my positioning problems and he recommended flex positioning. I changed to using flex properties and this made it easier for me to position these elements.

  6. The burger mene would not display as expected on small screen sizes. I spoke to my mentor who reviewed this issue and told me to lok at my media queries overlapping. the problem was that the small screen size was being overuled by larger screen sizes which had the CSS command of display:None;. I addressed this issue by creating a minimum width media query which prevented the larger screen media query from flowing down to the smaller screens. This was all achieved with assistance from my mentor.


## <U>**W3C Validator**</U>

* The W3C validator was used to to validate the html on all pages of this website. No errors were returned when passing through the W3C validator.
 
  * [Home Page HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2F8000-johncci-soccercampforki-lzzw06ry160.ws-eu54.gitpod.io%2Findex.html)
  * [Gallery Page HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2F8000-johncci-soccercampforki-lzzw06ry160.ws-eu54.gitpod.io%2Fgallery.html)
  * [Sign Up Page HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2F8000-johncci-soccercampforki-lzzw06ry160.ws-eu54.gitpod.io%2Fsignup.html)

  <br>

## <u>**LightHouse**</u>

* I applied the lighthouse tool to this project which is located in the Chrome Developer Tools. There are four areas tested in the lighthouse test.


  * Performance
  * Accessibility
  * Best Practices
  * SEO

<br>

### **Home Page**

The following images in this section are displayed as lighthouse desktop as the first image and lighthouse mobile as the second image.
<br>

1. The image below displays the lighthouse desktop score for the home page. The performance score was diplaying as 76 on a mobile device and 85 on a desktop device. I consulted with my mentor about the score and he informed me the size of the main image was having a negative impact on performance score.


2. I used the website [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/) to address this problem. I resized image and this increased the performance score to 99 on the desktop devices and 95 on the mobile devices. The increase in score came directly as a result of these changes as confirmed through retesting.

![Lighthouse home desktop score](assets/images/lighthouse-desktop-home.png)

![Lighthouse home mobile score](assets/images/lighthouse-home-mobile.png)

<br>

### **Gallery Page**

The following images in this section are displayed as lighthouse desktop as the first image and lighthouse mobile as the second image.
<br>

1. The Image displayed below displays a desktop score of 100 for every section. The first lighthouse mobile score was 86 for performance and 93 on desktop.

2. The performance issue was addressed by converting the largest image file to webp and by changing the aspect ratio of the images using ezgif. The performance score increased to 100 on desktop and 99 on mobile.

<br>

### **SIGN UP PAGE**

The following images in this section are displayed as lighthouse desktop as the first image and lighthouse mobile as the second image.
<br>

1. The background image on this page was effecting perfomance. The lighthouse suggestion was to serve the image in a next gen format. The original perfomance score was 89.

2. I addressed this issue by again using ezgif.com and increased the performance score to 96.
